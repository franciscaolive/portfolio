        <p>
          This project was developed for the course unit Multimédia II, in 2024
          in collaboration with Festival Internacional de Artes e Ópera do
          Porto.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was proposed to us the creation of an Augmented Reality app, that
          brought the posters in the Festival to life. This project was
          developed in group, with my colleagues Alice Logvina and Ana Pinto. I
          took care of every visual 2D component, with Procreate and Adobe
          Illustrator. My colleagues developed the app in Unity and creatd the
          3D elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were in charge of developing this project for the operas
          <em>Rigoletto</em> and <em>Turandot</em>. For <em>Rigoletto</em>, we
          decided to create a 3D chess board, that would recreate a snippet of
          the opera in a small animation. In this opera, the main characters are
          the Court Jester, his daughter and the Duke of Mãntua. It's a tragic
          story that tells us about betrayal and vengeance. While trying to plan
          the murder of the Duke, the Jester hires a killer that ends up killing
          his daughter. That's the scene we decided to animate for this poster.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Turandot</em> is an opera that tells the story of Princess
          Turandot. Her father is forcing her to find a man to marry, and so she
          prepares three riddles for her suitors, promising to get married to
          the one who got all three of them correctly. The ones that get them
          wrong, are killed. So, in this project, we decided to present to the
          public the riddles created by the princess in the style of a 2D quiz.
