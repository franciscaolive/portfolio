        <p>
          Jenkins was developed within the course unit Programming III,
          whose proposal was to create a program in Processing that produces a
          sequence of generative images to create a real-time video, based on
          the user's sound input. In other words, to create a video with a mixed
          methodology that explores the aesthetic and technical possibilities of
          Processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was developed entirely in Processing, an open-source programming
          language and integrated development environment. This code
          incorporates various inputs: the letters S, D, and H; the arrow keys;
          and the numbers from 1 to 5. It also uses the left mouse button, as
          well as mouse dragging. Regarding the output, this project was made to
          produce various graphic animations that react to sound, such as a
          sound wave, triangles generated through mouse movement, circles that
          appear when the D key is pressed, random geometric shapes generated by
          clicking the H key, circles that appear on the screen with the S key
          and are removed by the mouse, and circles that appear when the arrow
          keys are pressed. Additionally, by pressing keys 1 to 5, we can see
          different images from the film <em>Marie Antoinette</em> (2006), which
          overlap and disappear when the same keys are pressed again.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was done in collaboration with my colleague Alice
          Logvina. We worked together to produce the various components in
          Processing. She handled the 3D objects like the cube and the terrain,
          and I handled the programming of the other elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, in collaboration with the Interface Design course unit, this
          project evolved into an interactive installation, using Processing and
          an Arduino simultaneously, thus creating 5 Shades of Pink.

        <p>
          Me and my colleague Alice Logvina once again worked together, and we
          both worked on all components such as coding in Processing and
          utilizing the Arduino.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, we used the graphic developments from our midterm
          work and introduced interactivity through Arduino and a webcam.
        </p>
        <p>
          The webcam, detecting light, generates small triangles in the
          illuminated area. The cube also rotates depending on the position of
          the light. In addition, with the Arduino, we had 4 buttons in the
          center of the room to switch between these components.
