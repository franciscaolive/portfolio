          Glitch Box is an interactive installation, inspired by the Nintendo
          game, <em>Super Mario</em>, that allows for the spectator to interact
          with a 3D asset, a surprise box. Every time the spectator touches this
          box, it plays a sound and disappears, appearing elsewhere, ready to
          repeat that event. The box can randomly appear in any part of the
          screen. and the spectator has to move around the entire room to be
          able to successfuly play.

          My colleague Alice Logvina and I developed this project together under
          the guidance of Professor Tiago Dionísio. We chose to use a Kinect in
          combination with Max and Processing, and created a patch that
          communicates via OSC. In Max, we were able to associate spheres with
          the hands, which allowed us to detect movements and generate real-time
          interactions. We integrated the 3D patch with the full scene,
          including elements like the castle, clouds, and the 'mystery box',
          which became the centerpiece of the interactive experience. We worked
          on the collision between objects and the hands, creating distinct
          sound responses for each one, and adjusted the movement axes for
          greater realism. To improve the scene's lighting, we explored Max's
          documentation and added light parameters that made the environment
          brighter and more immersive. The clouds were animated to bring more
          dynamism to the installation, and to complete the experience, we
          decided to include the Super Mario music, which plays on a loop
          throughout the interaction.
