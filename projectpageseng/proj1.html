      <div class="project-description">
        <p>
          <em>the fifth season</em> is a 2D game developed in Godot that
          immerses players in the world of fashion, allowing them to experience
          Fashion Week. Players take on the role of aspiring fashion icons,
          facing creative and social challenges while shaping their rise in the
          industry. The editorial and sophisticated aesthetic blends with an
          engaging narrative, offering a dynamic experience where players’
          choices influence their character’s development and journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combining fashion, strategy, and personalization, the game allows
          players to choose one of the four fashion capitals and participate in
          social and creative events that determine their success. The goal is
          to create an immersive experience accessible to a young audience,
          showcasing fashion as a form of personal expression. The Fifth Season
          aims to innovate in the dress-up game genre by offering a deep
          narrative with multiple endings based on player decisions.
        </p>

          This is the final project of my Bachelor's degree and it's currently
          being developed.
