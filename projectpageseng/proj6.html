        <p>
          This project was developed for the course unit Multimédia II in 2024,
          in collaboration with Centro de Tropas de Operações Especiais de
          Lamego.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this project, our mission was to develop innovative digital
          products that enrich and promote the museum experience of CTOE, to
          better transmit their historic and cultural elements, in its branches
          and military missions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was developed in collaboration with my colleagues Alice
          Logvina and Ana Pinto. After visiting the CTOE space, we brainstormed
          and decided we'd create a rescue mission inside the museum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rangers are known for their rescue missions, so we decided to create a
          game with that theme for android. It's in a treasure hunt style, in
          which the player gets selected to rescue the leopard in CTOE's symbol.
          The player has to answer questions about the history of CTOE, and the
          answers are in the contents of the museum. The game includes a map
          with an exclamation point that indicates in which room of the museum
          the answer can be found.
        </p>
        <p>
          This game was developed in Unity and the visual components were
          created in Procreate and Adobe Illustrator.
